In this exercise we helped our client Roza visualize some bacterial data from volunteers. We wanted to make it easy for her volunteers to identify the top ten bacteria in their belly buttons. To do this we created an html platform with a customized dashboard that allows the user to use a bar, bubble, gauge chart, and drop down menu to look at their different bacteria.
